            messages is a list of messages to be executed. The required signers of
             those messages define the number and order of elements in AuthInfo's
             signer_infos and Tx's signatures. Each required signer address is added to
             the list only the first time it occurs.
             By convention, the first required signer (usually from the first message)
             is referred to as the primary signer and pays the fee for the whole
             transaction.

        unordered:
          type: boolean
          description: |-
            unordered, when set to true, indicates that the transaction signer(s)
             intend for the transaction to be evaluated and executed in an un-ordered
             fashion. Specifically, the account's nonce will NOT be checked or
             incremented, which allows for fire-and-forget as well as concurrent
             transaction execution.

             Note, when set to true, the existing 'timeout_timestamp' value must
             be set and will be used to correspond to a timestamp in which the transaction is deemed
             valid.

             When true, the sequence value MUST be 0, and any transaction with unordered=true and a non-zero sequence value will
             be rejected.
             External services that make assumptions about sequence values may need to be updated because of this.
        timeoutTimestamp:

            timeout_timestamp is the block time after which this transaction will not

             Note, if unordered=true this value MUST be set
             and will act as a short-lived TTL in which the transaction is deemed valid
             and kept in memory to prevent duplicates.
