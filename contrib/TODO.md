# TODO

- move all required envs into .env.example when done inspecting
- update .envrc to check for those env changes but from the real .env
- turn complicated dkg test script into useful demo.compose.yaml
- rename and move current compose.yaml to dev.compose.yaml and move it to contrib as well
- update makefile setup to target correct new locations of compose files
- add "make demo" to showcase the demo easily to product manager
- note down in a DEMO_PLAN.md that we need a transaction from the chain to start the dkg and declare that signer as leader in chain-watch to kick off the network
